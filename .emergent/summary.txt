The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the NK Board Game application from an MVP to a highly refined frontend. The initial focus involved building the core React application with Tailwind CSS, integrating S3 assets, and establishing foundational pages. The development trajectory was characterized by iterative refinement and extensive content updates driven by user feedback. Key achievements included a significant overhaul of the Play at Shop page with dynamic game lists and detailed pricing, the About Us page with dynamic team data and persistent mobile responsiveness fixes, and the Photo Booth page with a Kawaii re-theme and image modals. The engineer consistently addressed usability issues, such as ensuring navigation links scrolled to the top and diligently resolving mobile overflow issues across various iPhone sizes. My analysis reveals a methodical and persistent problem-solving approach, especially in addressing reported bugs like CSS compilation errors, confirming each fix through verification steps, and ensuring all explicit user requests are met.
