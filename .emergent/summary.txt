The previous AI engineer successfully brought the NK Board Game application from concept to a polished frontend MVP. The initial phase focused on building the core React application with Tailwind CSS, integrating S3 image assets, and implementing foundational pages (Home, About Us, Services, Contact) with mock data. Key early challenges involved precise design adherence and responsive layouts, particularly for the hero section and image assets.

The subsequent development trajectory, which I analyzed, was characterized by iterative refinement and extensive content updates based on user feedback. Significant effort was dedicated to overhauling specific pages: the homepage gallery was transformed with branch-specific tabs and an image modal; the Photo Booth page underwent a comprehensive Kawaii re-theme, including package updates and a How-to Use section; and the 'About Us' page was heavily revised with a new story, dynamic 30-member team display from an Excel sheet, and updated founder details. Critical usability improvements included implementing full-screen image modals with navigation, ensuring navigation links scrolled to the top, and, most notably, diligently resolving persistent mobile overflow issues on the 'About Us' page across various iPhone screen sizes. My analysis of the trajectory shows a detailed, persistent approach to meeting user expectations, often iterating on fixes (e.g., caching, mobile responsiveness) until confirmed resolved.

<current_work>
The application is a fully functional and highly customized frontend MVP for the NK Board Game website, built using React and Tailwind CSS. All core pages (Home, About, Services, Contact) are implemented, populated with mock/dynamic data (where applicable), and heavily styled according to detailed user requirements for a fun and vibrant theme targeting Gen Z.

The most recent significant work was dedicated to **resolving persistent mobile layout overflow issues on the 'About Us' page**. Specifically, after previous attempts, the user reported content still overflowing on iPhone 16 Pro. The AI engineer thoroughly investigated by simulating the iPhone 16 Pro's viewport (393px width). The issue was traced to  and  elements exceeding the viewport. The solution involved:
1.  **Global Container Adjustments:** Applied , , and  specifically for  media query in .
2.  **Story Section Specific Fixes:** Used  to force  on  and . Changed  to  and . Changed  to  for mobile.
3.  **About Page Box-sizing:** Ensured  was applied to all elements within the .

These iterative fixes, verified with multiple screenshots on simulated iPhone 16 Pro, 375px, and 320px viewports, successfully eliminated all horizontal scrolling and ensured the content fits perfectly within the screen boundaries.

Other recently completed tasks include:
-   **Photo Booth Gallery:** Implemented full-screen modal with image navigation (left/right arrows) and keyboard controls (arrows, Escape key).
-   **Navigation Consistency:** Ensured both Header and Footer links automatically close menus/dropdowns and scroll the page to the top upon navigation.
-   **Photo Booth Add-ons:** Updated services to include Birthday Theme and revised prices for Wig Rental and Private Photographer.
-   **Homepage Re-theming:** Applied vibrant backgrounds, animated gradients, and interactive elements to make the homepage more fun and lively.
-   **About Us Team Section:** Dynamically populated with 35 team members from an Excel sheet, including generation tags and real S3 images, with specific image URL fixes for Ja-Oh and Prem.

The website is currently stable, fully responsive (after the recent fixes), and adheres to all user-specified design and content requirements.
